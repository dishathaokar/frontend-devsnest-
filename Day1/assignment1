            Respected Sir,<br> I am Disha Thaokar, a student currently studying in 2<sup>nd</sup> year IT Department. 
            There is a mentorship program conducted by 'Devsnest' to help us get our dream job. 
            Their main motive is to guide students to become a good developer.
            This program is of 40 days which is going to be held in Delhi. 
        <p>This program will also focus on programming languages like - </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li> C</li>
            <li> C++ etc</li>
        </ul>
        Each phase is going to be covered in a span of 20 days. The program consists of 3 phases:
        </p>
        <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Phase 1</th>
            <th>Phase 2</th>
            <th>Phase 3</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DSA</td>
            <td>Front-end Development</td>
            <td>Back-end Development</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p> Being in It field, this program will really help me to improve my skills and boost up my confidence.
             So, It's my humble request to you to let me join this program and I promise after returning back I will cover all my backlogs.
